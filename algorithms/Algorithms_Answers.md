Exercise 1-
a)O(n)
b)O(n^3)
c)O(log n)

Exercise 2- Assuming the building is 10 floors, my strategy would be to go up to the 5th floor and drop an egg. If the egg breaks, I go down 1 floor, else I go up 1 floor. However in reality though these are eggs so I wouldn't expect one to survive a 1 story drop unless they were landing on a special mattress. In the case it was a special mattress and the biggest goal was to break the least amount of eggs to determine the exact floor they break, I would likely just go up a floor at a time so that I only lose 1 egg in the process.
